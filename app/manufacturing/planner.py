    Reactions: Industry/AdvIndustry and the BX implant do not apply — the implant's
    attribute is "Manufacturing Time Bonus" and reactions are a separate activity.

    Rounding happens ONCE, on the total — NOT per run. Rounding per run and then
    multiplying inflates the error by the run count: a 17 s/run job with 5625 runs
    lost a whole second per run to rounding, i.e. ~1.5 h on one job, and small
    bonuses (BX-801's 1 %) vanished entirely because they could not tip the
    per-run rounding. Sources agree the run count sits inside the product:
      - Qoi, "Formulas for EVE Industry" v2.2:
        productionTime = baseProductionTime * timeModifier * skillModifier * runs
        (the same document spells out ceil(round(...)) for MATERIALS and gives the
        time formula no rounding at all)
      - CCP/Fenris support, "Time Efficiency Research": "Job time = Blueprint
        manufacturing run time * number of production runs * Time Efficiency
        Reduction factor"
    Note: per-JOB rounding of MATERIAL quantities is a real and separate mechanic —
    that is what BOMResolver.runs_per_job models. Do not conflate the two.
    No source states whether the fractional final second is floored, ceiled or
    rounded; that is a ≤1 s question on a whole job, so round() is used.
