"""
Make vs. Buy optimizer.

Algorithm (bottom-up):
  For each node in the tree we compute the optimal cost:
  - leaf:     input_price × quantity
  - non-leaf: min(make_cost, buy_cost)
              make_cost = job install fee + sum of children's optimal costs
              buy_cost  = input_price × quantity

  make_cost includes the node's OWN job install fee (node.job_fee) and the
  invented blueprint it needs (node.invention_cost) so the decision is all-in:
  building a component only wins if its materials + fee + BPC beat buying it.
  Without the fee term the optimizer over-selects "make" and the (real) install
  fees then silently erase the paper savings; invention is the same class of
  term and much larger on a T2 component, where the BPC can outweigh the
  materials. A bought T2 component carries someone else's invention cost in its
  price, so the comparison is only fair when the make side carries ours.

  input_price is Jita sell (index 0) or Jita buy (index 1) depending on the
  `input_basis` argument — real builders source inputs from buy orders, which
  is cheaper than instant-buying at sell.

  The result is the minimum total cost and a list of decisions for each intermediate.
